This week I had the pleasure of seeing Dr Leah Buechley talk at the ATLAS Institute. Dr Buechley is the creator of the [LillyPad](http://www.geeetech.com/wiki/index.php/Arduino_LilyPad) Arduino Kit. She is known for her work with paper based computing as well as other E-textiles. She directed the High-Low Tech research group at MIT where she worked as an associate professor.

The subject of this talk was "Beautiful, meaningful computing: Identity and Engagement in the context of CS for all". Dr Buechley has a vision where students of any age or background can be expressive and creative through Computer Science. This vision is an extension of a movement called [CSforALL](https://www.csforall.org/). CSforAll's mission is to "make high-quality computer science an integral part of the educational experience of all K-12 students and teachers and to support student pathways to college and career success."

Since the beginning of Computer Science, Computing has had its roots in The Arts. Dr. Buechley points out the [Logo programming language](http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/history.html), created at MIT in the 1970s. The Logo project is used to "develop simulations, and to create multimedia presentations and games." It's designed to "have a low threshold and no ceiling". A popular implementation of Logo is the [Turtle](http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/logo_primer.html), a mechanical turtle that sat on the ground and responded to computer commands. Eventually the Turtle was used to create shapes, designs and graphics. Consider the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming environment. Scratch is deeply connected to visual expression through Computing.

These examples reflect Dr. Buechley's vision of combining Computing, Mathemetics, Art and Engineering.

Why do these connections need to happen? Today, most Computer Science education happens outside of public schools. Many students don't have access to the educational resources required to learn about Computing. Even if the resources are available, studies have shown that student engagement in Computing decreases as students rise from 5th to 12th grade. Creativity and Visual Arts are keys for engaging young students in Computing. 

In order for students to become engaged, they need to understand how the material they are learning is relevant to their future or their current interests. The Arts provide a powerful way for students to connect their identity to society. In addition, [studies have shown](http://www.sjsu.edu/people/kathie.kratochvil/courses/CA177/s0/Catterall-2009-Doing-Well-Doing-Good.pdf) that engagement in The Arts correlates with greater success later in life.

How does Computer Science fit into The Arts? Contrary to common perspective, Computing is an "inrinsically creative discipline", as Buechley puts it. It's all about making, building, *creating* things. After all, Computing has its roots in The Arts. Dr. Buechley encourages us to embrace the intertwining of Art and Computing.

This can be difficult to accept. Art is something that is at the core of being Human. It's how we express and make sense of ourselves and society. Computers are commonly seen as boring tools. Machines that do our bidding. However, Computing can also be used for *expression*, esspecially expression of identity. Technology is being infused with fashion, ceramics, visual art, music and so much more. Algorithms and Machine Learning are being used to create [amazing pieces of art](https://aeon.co/essays/how-algorithms-are-transforming-artistic-creativity). 

Computing and The Arts were not only meant for each other, they inspire each other.

## Past Projects

Find my projects here: [lucasdachman.github.io/works.html](https://lucasdachman.github.io/works.html)

They include:
- The Foot Step Sequencer - an interactive music experience that uses the positions of people on the floor to create music patterns
- A wearable midi controller that uses the position of the users foot to send control signals to any music software
- Cirkit - an iPhone app that does common circuit calculations
- Resistor Calculator - an Android app that displays resistor information based on band color coding
- Wake / Make - A moving typographic sculpture
- Web Synth - the music maker on the home page of my portfolio. It shows my interests in both programming and music tech

## Domains

Here is a list of the domains covered in my top projects:

- Music Tech
- Arduino
- Midi / controllers
- Programming
- Movement
- Wearables
- Mobile Apps
- Physical computing/hacking
- Typography
- 3D printing
- Web Design / Front-End Engineering
- Interactivity

More generally, each of my projects fall into one or more of these categories: **Programming, Music Tech, Physical Computing.**

## Why?

What makes me like these things? 

- Programming
    - I like to create things
    - I like having control over my creations
    - I can make complex things quickly
    - I get stuck in the zone when I do it
    - I can collaborate with other creative/intelligent people
    - I can apply it to many fields (interdisciplinary)
    - I like to solve problems
    - I am always learning (complex and fast-evolving field)
    - I can build off of other peoples work (open source)
- Music Tech
    - I like creating things
    - I like mixing things that are structured with things that are organic
    - I like having control over my creations
    - I like buttons and knobs
    - I like music with a strong rhythm component
    - I like new things
    - I want to create unique musical instruments
    - It's interdisciplinary
- Physical Computing
    - It's fun to make things with your hands
    - I can easily show off my projects (because they are physical)
    - I learn new concepts/technologies for every project
    - I get to write code

It turns out I have some similar reasons for interest in these domains. I like to **create** things, I like having a high degree of **control** over my creations, I like to be **interdisciplinary**, I want to **learn** all the time.

## Research Questions

- <s>What place do modern technologies (computers) take in the music making process?</s>
- <s>How can web technologies be applied to music production?</s>
- <s>What are practical alternatives to buttons and knobs? How can gestures and movement be used in the music making process?</s>


- What makes new instruments novel or successful?
- What is the smallest set of controls that can be used to make an interesting electronic instrument?
- How can note triggering and sound manipulation (on an electronic instrument) be combined into a single gesture to improve expression during performance?
- How can visual or haptic feedback from an electronic instrument improve the creative process of a music producer?

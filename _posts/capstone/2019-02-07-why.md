### Abstraction

A central part of most of my past projects is abstraction. When I create something, I want to handle all of the small details to create a simple user experience. The user may think they're in control but in reality I – the creator – am in control. My goal is to take something complex and strip away the details in favor of something minimal yet powerful.

# Collaborative Canvas

This prototype focuses on the implementation of collaborative web interfaces.

[**Demo App**](https://draw-collab.herokuapp.com/)

[Github](https://github.com/LucasDachman/draw-collab)

Each user is assigned a different color when visiting the website. Clicking a cell in the grid colors the cell or removes the color. Other user's pointer positions are displayed as colored dots.

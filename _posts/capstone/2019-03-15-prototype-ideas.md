## Shared Web UI (Implementation)
Prototype a shared state application where users can view and control a single application from different browsers

- User should be able to join a room with a friend (or anonymous user)
- use a server to track shared application state
    - WebSockets?
    - Shared audio stream?
- minimal UI for visual feedback

## Generative Music (Implementation)
Use Tone.js or SuperCollider to experiment with generative music.

- Experiment with
    - chance and probability
    - musical scales
    - sound texture
    - timing and note triggering
    - Tone.js / SuperCollider

## GM Interaction Flow Chart (Role & Functionality)

Decide what functionality a generative music program can/should have.

- what controls will be available to the User?
- what are the inputs / mappings?

## Generative Music UI (Look & Feel)

- visual mockups that include
    - layout
    - colors
    - UI components
    - interactive graphics
    - OpenGL?

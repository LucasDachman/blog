## My Favorites

### Collaborative Mobile App Groove Machine

The app would be able to act as one out of a number of components: drum machine, bass synth, chords synth, lead synth etc. Each group member would choose an instrument. The apps would sync through bluetooth or wifi.

### Weather Based Music

This idea involves getting data from a weather API and using that data to control parameters of songs. This could take the form of a web app or a physical device.

### One Knob Synthesizer

The One Knob Synthesizer plays off themes of minimalism and abstraction. The idea is to create a digital synthesizer (hardware or software) with preset sounds. Each preset will have multiple parameters mapped to the one knob for timbre based expression.

### Single Purpose Instrument Plugin Set

A set of individual software instruments, each with a specific purpose and sound. Generally, electronic instruments strive to be feature packed and multi-purpose. I'd like to build software instruments that are minimal and have individual characters like gritty, soft, big etc.

# Sauce Sense
**A Precision Condiment Appliance**

Sauce Sense is a smart appliance that knows how to sauce your food. Wether you're making a hotdog or a pbj, you're totally covered. Sauce sense comes with ketchup, mustard, siracha, jam, peanut butter and more.

We made our prototype out of cardboard and pens. We used a box to show where food is inserted and cut a cardboard circle to show the sauce carousel.

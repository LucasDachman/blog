## Photo Editing Application

My photo editing app allows users to apply pre-configured filters to images from the device's library. Available filters include sepia, noir, vintage and chrome. Additionally, users can edit the exposure, hue, and saturation settings. The app uses Apple's [Core Graphics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics) and [Core Image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage) frameworks to manipulate the images. Filters are applied sequentially and the order can be edited.


### Improvements

I think the UI could have better flow. There may be too many views to tap through. Users would probably want to see the image while they are editing it. A UI layout with controls on the same page as the image would work better. A great feature for this app would be the ability to save custom filter configurations.

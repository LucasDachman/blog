# Cirkit

- [Milestone 1](milestone-1)
- [Milestone 2](milestone-2)

## What went well

The calculations were easy to implement. They consisted of basic laws of electricity which I found online. 

I wanted the UI to be simple and intuitive. If the forms are incomplete, the result label shows a dash. Any time the forms are edited, the app checks if it has enough information to make the calculation. If all the forms are completed, it displays the result. No "calculate" button needed.

The design of the user interface was easy to replicate from my mockups in Adobe XD. I sketched out the layout in order to realize where stack views should go and which constraints they should get.

## What didn't go well

I wanted to use graphics to make the UI more intuitive. I created simple circuit graphics in adobe XD and exported them as pdf files so they would be in a vector format and could be scaled easily. A problem I ran into was getting the images to scale correctly at different screen sizes. If I had more time, I would create each individual component of the graphics in xcode so that it would scale with auto-layout.

# Resistor Calculator
An app that calculates resistor values based on color codes
- [Part 1](p2-milestone-1)
- [Part 2](p2-milestone-2)
- (part 3 in class)

I referenced the charts from [this site](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/resistor-color-code-calculator/) as a guide for the logic. Each of the tabs have similar elements so I wanted to reuse as much code as possible. Unfortunately, Android makes it difficult to nest `fragment`s inside each other so I had to create new UI elements for each tab. Fortunately, they all use the same resource `style` so it was easy to edit the margins and appearance. The constraint layout was easy to use but I preferred the stack views from iOS. Something I could have done differently was using resources for the colors. Instead, I assigned the colors programmatically in a `ResistorColor` class.

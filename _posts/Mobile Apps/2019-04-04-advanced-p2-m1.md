# Mission

*Mission* is a minimal task tracking application for Android. Mission's philosophy is that a person should only be focused on three major tasks (missions) at once. Any other missions are backlogged to avoid distractions. Each mission is made of a series of smaller tasks. A user can change the priority of tasks within a mission or change the priority of a mission relative to other missions. No matter how many missions are created, only the top three are shown on the main screen. Each task can also have labels for better organization. 

The goal of Mission is to facilitate focus through attention organization.

On Tuesday, September 4th, I had the pleasure of touring the SparkFun offices in Niwot, Colorado. SparkFun Electronics was created by Nathan Seidle at The Univesity of Colorado Boulder in 2003. His goal was to provide an easy way for people (especially students and hobbyists) to buy microcontrollers and breakout boards online. The companies main goal being education, all of their products are created as open-source hardware.

## Description

Cirkit is a productivity app aimed at users learning about basic circuits. The app provides information about resistor color codes and equivilant resistor values of resistor pairs in series or parallel. 

## Similar Apps

Related apps in the apple app store have similar functionality. Some are overcrowded with ugly graphics and some are minimal with no illustrations of circuits. I'd like to create an app that has a balance between visual depictions and typographic information.

## Formulas

The calculations in this app will use Ohm's law
```
Volts(V) = Amps(I) x Ohms(Î©)
```

and derivations of it 

```
Resistors in series: Req = R1 + R2
Resistors in parallel: 1/Req = 1/R1 + 1/R2
```

### Lab Objectives

- Explore serial communication between Arduino and P5
- Learn how to appropriately format data to send between devices
- Build an interface using P5

### Materials & Software

- Arduino
- breadboard
- 2 potentiometers
- (p5.js)[https://p5js.org/]
- (p5 serial control app)[https://github.com/vanevery/p5.serialcontrol/releases]

### Summary

The lab uses the p5.serialcontrol app to allow serial communication between the arduino and a web application. The arduino reads analog values from the potentiometers and sends them to the p5.js application. The web app uses these values to change the shape of a triangle on the screen
